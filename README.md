# Graphene-Python is a library for building GraphQL APIs in Python easily, its main goal is to provide a simple but extendable API for making developers' lives easier.

But, what is GraphQL? GraphQL is a data query language developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015. It provides an alternative to REST and ad-hoc webservice architectures.

We believe that GraphQL is the next big thing after peanut butter and REST.
